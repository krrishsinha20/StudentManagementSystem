# Student Management System

## Project Overview
This Java program demonstrates the concepts of **classes, array of objects, instance members, and constructors**. The program allows users to manage student records with operations such as **adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting students**.

## Features Implemented
- **Student Class**: Stores attributes such as PRN, name, DoB, and marks.
- **ArrayList of Students**: Used for dynamic storage and easy manipulation.
- **Menu-Driven System**: Provides an interactive console-based interface.
- **Operations Implemented**:
  1. **Add Student**
  2. **Display All Students**
  3. **Search Student** (By PRN, By Name, By Position)
  4. **Update/Edit Student Details**
  5. **Delete Student**

## Files in the Repository
1. `Main.java` - Contains the main menu-driven logic.
2. `Student.java` - Defines the **Student** class with attributes and methods.
3. `StudentOperations.java` - Implements all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.

## Coding Guidelines Followed
- Proper class structure and **modular approach**.
- **Each operation is a separate function** for clarity.
- **JavaDocs** and comments added for better understanding.
- Used **ArrayList** for dynamic student storage.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krrishsinha20/StudentManagementSystem.git
   ```
2. **Compile and Run**:
   ```sh
